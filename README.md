Logging http(s) requests for all calls made from the network interface has usually been done with [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) but has not been something that is light weight that can run for extended periods. cproxy aims to be a minimal daemon that logs and visualizes network history over time, while also acting as a time capsule for your internet history.

## Installation

```
npm install cproxy -g
```
## Usage

```
cproxy
